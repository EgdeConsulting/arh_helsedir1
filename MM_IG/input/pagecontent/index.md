This IG is an example of how the exeisting XPR 'mini-melding' could be modelled with FHIR Resources and described using FHIR Shortyhand (FSH). The original specification can be found here: [iplos-56.0.0/XPR(ipl).xsd](https://github.com/hdir/DHHR.API/blob/master/message-specifications/iplos-56.0.0/XPR(ipl).xsd)

The (diagram below)[#id1] shows the data content from the original alongside an equivalent FHIR structure.

# Notes on functional structure:

## Overall structure
To model the levels of the xpr structure this version uses a top level FHIR Bundle resource of type "Message" to represent the "Melding". In order to model one-to-many Notifications within the "Melding" we use a new Bundle of type "Message" under the Melding bundle. This Bundle is described using a MessageHeader, MessageDefinition resources and provides 'focus' for 1 payload "Encounter" resource.

## Message protocol considerations
Note that this message is a fire-and-forget type of message and is not RESTful. We have therefore not followed the FHIR messaging guidance ["Messaging using FHIR Resources"](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/messaging.html). A re-development of Norway's messaging to health registers could benefit from reviewing the messaging protocols used in relation to FHIR messaging.

XPR uses the statusNotifikasjon to determine if the message is an original or a correction. In this FHIR example we have used an Event in the Notifikasjon MessageHeader to target an endpoint URL. 

Example:
- Kodeverk 7316 = N "Original" is sent to the receiving server EventUri = "http://hddr.no/iplosikpr_submission"
- Kodeverk 7316 = M "KorrigerErstatt" to EventUri = "http://hddr.no/iplosikpr_replace"

## Notification types
XPR Minimelding has 5 types of notification which are defined within the Encounter resource using the standard FHIR status flags:
- 'arrived' = TjenesteStart;
- 'onleave' = Midlertidlig stopp fra; 
- 'planned' = Midlertidlig stopp til 
- 'finished' = Tjeneste Slutt
- 'entered-in-error' = Tjenesteutf√∏rer endret

## FHIR Data Model {#id1}
The following diagram shows the chosen FHIR data model with the equivalent data fields from the XPR format:

Internal notes and files can be found in Confluence.

TODO Checklist:
1. Profiling needs improved slicing definitions
2. Work required to refer to no-basis profiles where possible
3. Add multi-notification example
6. Model a HST version
